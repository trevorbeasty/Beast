# Leeft
 Leeft is a weightlifting record-keeping and active guidance mobile application

## Workout Log
The workout log can be navigated by month and date via the date controls at the top of the view.  The toolbar at the bottom of the view allows for manipulation of existing content as well as specialized date selection

## Routine Creation
A routine is a structured collection of workout targets with a defined order.  The user can define the size of the structure (number of exercises and rounds) and configure targets as desired (weight, reps, rest).  The size of the structure can be adjusted in real time and targets can be turned on or off.

## Routine Selection
Routines can be browsed in a similar fashion to completed workout.  Using the bottom controls, the user can quickly view the entire routine history, change the search criteria, and launch into 'active guidance' mode (where the app takes the user through a routine)

## Routine Active Guidance
The user is taken through a routine that they made.  They are shown previous marks (if the routine has been previously completed), current targets, and presented with a streamlined input sequence upon completion.  Rest targets are also automatically fed to the timer, and alerts are sent to the user in advance of the intended start time for their next set
