// break it out.  Use xibs as much as possible cause adding constraints programmatically sucks ass.     One exercise component will consist of 2 classes - (1) a class that has the title bar and column labels and dynamically adds rows as needed (2) the class that constitutes a single row;  it's container view will be added as a subview to class in (1) and I will need to add programmatic constraints there.  (1) will also load 1 of 2 nibs based on whether or not targets vary across rounds;
